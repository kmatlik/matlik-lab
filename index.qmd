Neurons are born early in development and mature shortly after that. Most types of mammalian neurons are not replaced during the individual's lifetime. As a result, after neurons have matured and become fully functional, they must remain so for a long time -- in humans, for up to a hundred years or more. 

<a href = "https://taltech.ee/en/department-chemistry-biotechnology/division-of-gene-technology-and-biomedicine#p7751045">Our lab</a> at the Tallinn University of Technology aims to uncover the epigenetic mechanisms that guide neuronal maturation and ensure the maintenance of neuronal function over the course of a lifetime. We use a combination of methods including primary neuronal cultures, animal models, microscopy, genome-wide sequencing and bioinformatics to study chromatin and gene regulation in neurons. We hope this research helps us understand key questions about brain function in health and disease.
