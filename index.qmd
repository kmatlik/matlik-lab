## Laboratory of Neuroepigenetics  
<img src= "composite2.jpg" class="center fit" style="width: 47vw; min-width: 330px;">  

Neurons are born early in development and mature shortly after that. Most types of mammalian neurons are not replaced during the individual's lifetime. As a result, after neurons have matured and become fully functional, they must remain so for a long time -- in humans, for up to a hundred years or more. 

Our lab at the Tallinn University of Technology aims to uncover the epigenetic mechanisms that guide neuronal maturation and ensure the maintenance of neuronal function over the course of a lifetime. We use a combination of methods including primary neuronal cultures, animal models, microscopy, genome-wide sequencing and bioinformatics to study chromatin and gene regulation in neurons. We hope this research helps us understand key questions about brain function in health and disease.
