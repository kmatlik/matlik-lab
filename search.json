    "text": "Kärt Mätlik, Ph.D. \nGroup Leader\nKärt received her Ph.D. in Physiology and Neuroscience from the University of Helsinki, where she studied the role of neurotrophic factor regulation in midbrain dopamine system function under the mentorship of Jaan-Olle Andressoo and Mart Saarma. For her postdoctoral training, Kärt joined the Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology at Rockefeller University, led by Mary E. Hatten, where she investigated how chromatin modifications control cerebellar development. Kärt now runs the Neuroepigenetics research group at the Tallinn University of Technology, where she studies the intersection of epigenetics, gene expression and brain development.\n\n\n\nWe are recruiting!

    "text": "Laboratory of Neuroepigenetics\n\nNeurons are born early in development and mature shortly after that. Most types of mammalian neurons are not replaced during the individual’s lifetime. As a result, after neurons have matured and become fully functional, they must remain so for a long time – in humans, for up to a hundred years or more.\nOur lab at the Tallinn University of Technology aims to uncover the epigenetic mechanisms that guide neuronal maturation and ensure the maintenance of neuronal function over the course of a lifetime. We use a combination of methods including primary neuronal cultures, animal models, microscopy, genome-wide sequencing and bioinformatics to study chromatin and gene regulation in neurons. We hope this research helps us understand key questions about brain function in health and disease."

    "text": "During development, neurons undergo a series of functional and morphological changes to become mature neurons integrated into brain circuitry. The developmental progression of neuronal precursors is regulated by changes in gene expression, which, in turn, are controlled by the chromatin landscape. We are interested in understanding how chromatin mechanisms regulate the timing of developmental progression of immature neurons.\n\n\n\nOur work has revealed the importance of histone bivalency in regulating the appropriate timing of gene expression programs during neuronal maturation. Histone bivalency refers to the colocalisation of activating and repressive modifications on chromatin, and it is thought to maintain gene expression in a ‘paused’ state. Our studies on the cerebellum showed that if bivalency is perturbed, developing neurons skip glial-guided migration, an essential step in cerebellar cortex formation, and instead undergo premature maturation. We are now identifying novel bivalency regulators and exploring how bivalency is regulated in mouse and human neurons."

    "text": "Chromatin dynamics in developing and ageing neurons\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuronal maturation is accompanied by dynamic changes in chromatin 3D architecture and epigenetic modifications. These changes establish the transcriptional programs that control neuronal function. We are interested in how global and local changes in histone modifications such as H3K27me3 control chromatin interactions and gene expression. To address these questions, we use a variety of methods such as biochemistry, imaging, genome-wide sequencing, and bioinformatics in primary neurons and animal models. With these studies, we aim to define how chromatin mechanisms guide neuronal maturation and control neuronal identity and function during adulthood and ageing."
