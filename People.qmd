### Kärt Mätlik, Ph.D.  
<b>Group Leader</b>  
Kärt received her Ph.D. in Physiology and Neuroscience from the University of Helsinki, where she studied the role of neurotrophic factor regulation in midbrain dopamine system function under the mentorship of Jaan-Olle Andressoo and Mart Saarma. For her postdoctoral training, Kärt joined the Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology at Rockefeller University, led by Mary E. Hatten, where she investigated how chromatin modifications control cerebellar development. Kärt now runs the Neuroepigenetics research group at the Tallinn University of Technology, where she studies the intersection of epigenetics, gene expression, and brain development.
